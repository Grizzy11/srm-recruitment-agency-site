# SRM Recruitment Agency SRL — Free Website Template

A clean, multi-page HTML/CSS/JS site you can deploy anywhere (Replit, Netlify, GitHub Pages).

## Pages
- `index.html` — home
- `about.html` — about the agency
- `services.html` — services
- `countries.html` — countries served
- `for-job-seekers.html` — steps + €1200 milestone payments + Flutterwave link
- `employers.html` — employer request form
- `blog.html` — placeholder posts
- `contact.html` — contact + form

## Customize
- Update contact details in `footer_common` sections of each HTML, or do a global find/replace:
  - Email: srmrecruitmentagencysrl@gmail.com
  - WhatsApp: +44 7957 475155 (link uses wa.me/447957475155)
  - Payment: https://flutterwave.com/pay/mcw21mvsuvta
- Replace `assets/logo.svg` with your official red-bird logo if you like.
- Forms use [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co/) — free and no backend needed. Confirm your email once to activate.

## Deploy
### Replit
1. Create a new Replit (HTML, CSS, JS).
2. Upload all files/folders from this template.
3. Click Run and open the webview.

### GitHub Pages
1. Create a repo, upload files.
2. Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → root.
3. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

### Netlify
1. Drag & drop the folder onto app.netlify.com Sites.
2. Get a free URL instantly.

## Notes
- This mimics the *layout and structure* of popular recruitment sites but uses original copy and design.
- If you need payment status emails every 2 weeks, you'll need automation (e.g., Zapier + Google Sheets or a simple backend). I can add that later using free tiers.
